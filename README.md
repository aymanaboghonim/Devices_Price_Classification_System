# Devices Price Classification System## Project OverviewThe Devices Price Classification System is an AI system built using Python and Spring Boot. It predicts the price range of devices based on their specifications. The system consists of two main components:1. **Python Project**: Predicts device prices using machine learning models.2. **Spring Boot Project**: Provides RESTful API endpoints to interact with the Python model and manage device data.## Project Structure- `python_project/`: Contains the Python scripts for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.- `springboot_project/`: Contains the Spring Boot application for managing devices and calling the Python prediction model.## Setup Instructions### Python ProjectFor detailed instructions, refer to the [Python Project README](python_project/README.md).### Spring Boot ProjectFor detailed instructions, refer to the [Spring Boot Project README](springboot_project/README.md).## Authors- [Ayman Abo Ghonim](https://github.com/aymanaboghonim)
