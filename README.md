# Devices Price Classification System## DescriptionA comprehensive AI-based system for predicting and classifying device prices based on specifications. Built with Python for machine learning and Spring Boot for backend API services. Features data preprocessing, model training, real-time predictions, and SQLite integration. Developed by Ayman Abo Ghonim.## Initial Version and Future ImprovementsThis is an initial version of the project serving as a proof-of-concept (POC). The project is currently under development and continuous improvement. Future enhancements and improvements are planned, including:- **Further Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform additional EDA to better understand the dataset, identify and handle outliers, and apply different approaches to handle missing values.- **Data Preprocessing and Encoding**: Experiment with various data preprocessing and encoding techniques to improve model performance.- **Model Experimentation and Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)**: Try different machine learning models and optimize hyperparameters to find the best-performing model.- **Modularity and Documentation**: Increase and enhance the modularity of the project for better maintainability and scalability. Provide comprehensive documentation for all components.- **Simple Web Application**: Develop a simple web application to demonstrate the system's capabilities and provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the prediction model.- **Logging and Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring to track the performance and behavior of the system in real-time.- **Integration and Deployment**: Streamline the integration between Python and Spring Boot components and prepare for seamless deployment.## Project Structure- **python_project/**: Contains the Python scripts and notebooks for data preparation, model training, and prediction.- **spring_project/**: Contains the Spring Boot application for serving API endpoints and interacting with the Python model.## Getting Started### Prerequisites- Python 3.8 or higher- Java 11 or higher- Spring Boot 2.5 or higher- SQLite (for local database storage)- Any web browser### Setup1.
